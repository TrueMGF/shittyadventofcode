/*part 1
Imagine a spiral of death that starts with 1 right at the center. Now take a step to the right, and spiral around counter-clockwise, adding 1 for each step.
you'll get some meme like this:
17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23---> ..
now, get the manhattan distance from an input field to the field labeled 1.

what have i done to deserve this
